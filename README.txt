A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/CriticalMammal/pen/mJzLKv.

 Eye poking simulator. It blinks, looks around, checks you out, and doesn't like being poked. It kind of does its own thing when there's a lack of input, eventually going into a sort of temporary sleep mode.

Some research went into this. The blinking intervals are timed to be  realistic and the eye tracking also jumps between "smooth pursuit" to saccades. The pupil will also contract to emulate focusing when the cursor is near.

The code is kind of a mess atm, I'll clean it up in a bit.
